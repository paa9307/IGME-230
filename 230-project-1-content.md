# Castle Guard: The One Knight
## I. High Concept
It's like Geometry Wars except you have to defend a base instead of yourself.
## II. Genre
It is an Action Arcade game.
## III. Platform</h1>
The game will be definitely be playable on Desktop. I'm not sure if 
it will be playable on mobile because I don't know if the controls will fit.
## IV. Story
A lovely little castle is being attacked by knights who want to conquer
and pillage. Even though the little castle is lovely, it is still small 
and only has one knight. You play this brave knight sworn to protect your 
castle from invadors at any cost nessesary. You are equipt with a bow and 
arrow and a sword. Then you are sent out to do your duty until your last breath.
## V. Esthetics
The esthetic will be cartoonish. It will be extremely colorful too, kind of like a Mario or a Sonic game.
Adventurous music will be playing in the game. The music will sound like a mixture of Lord 
of the Rings and Game of Thrones meets Mario. I want music that will really get the 
player in the zone.
## VI. Gameplay
### Mechanics
You have to stop different types of enemies from breaching your castle walls
by going around the outside of the castle and killing them. The will be enemies 
that you can only damage with arrows, enemies you can only damage with a sword, 
and some with both. Some enemies will be smaller targets and some will be faster.
 You lose if you run out of lives or if the castle is breached. The game is endless
so you are playing to get the highest score possible or to just have fun killing knights.
### Controls
You use the keyboard to move and attack
- W: Move Up
- S: Move Down
- A: Move Left</li>
- D: Move Right</li>
- Up Arrow: Attack Up
- Down Arrow: Attack Down
- Left Arrow: Attack Left

### Teaching the Game
There will be a diagram of the game controls in the menu under 
controls. Pausing during gameplay will also let you access the 
game controls diagram.
### Player Learning
The player needs to figure out how the different type of enemies are different 
and what is the best and most likly fastest way to defeat them.

## IX. About the developer
My name is Paul Avallone and I am a Game Design and Development 
major in the B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information 
Sciences at RIT. I will be graduating in 2020 and go off to hopefully 
work at a great video game company. I can program in languages C#, 
Java, and "HTML". I can use softwear like Unity, Maya, Photoshop, and 
Movie Studio Platnium. On a less technical note, I like to watch movies,
play video games, and play racquetball. My favorite color is yellow.
